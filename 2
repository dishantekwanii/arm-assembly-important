  @ Debugging tips:
  @
  @ If using the View Memory window
  @   - view originalString using address "&originalString" and size 32
  @   - view newString using address "&newString" and size 32
  @
  @ If using a Watch Expression (array with ASCII character codes)
  @   view originalString using expression "(char[32])originalString"
  @   view newString using expression "(char[32])newString"
  @
  @ If using a Watch Expression (just see the string)
  @   view originalString using expression "(char*)&originalString"
  @   view newString using expression "(char*)&newString"

  @ End of program ... check your result
